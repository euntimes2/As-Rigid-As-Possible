#As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) Mesh Deformation — From Scratch

A clean and minimal implementation of the ARAP deformation model
(as introduced by Sorkine & Alexa, 2007).

✨ Features

Local step (SVD-based rotation estimation)

Global step (Poisson system solver)

Vertex handle constraints

Works on general triangular meshes

Pure Python / NumPy / SciPy implementatio
